# IBM Data Science Capstone Project – SpaceX Launch Success Analysis

This repository contains all Jupyter notebooks and deliverables completed for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project. The project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to identify trends and develop a predictive model for launch success.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL queries used to explore and summarize the dataset.
- Python-based data wrangling and visualization.
- Identification of trends across launch sites, booster versions, payload mass, and landing outcomes.

### 2. Interactive Map (Folium)
- Folium map created to visualize SpaceX launch site locations.
- Markers and circle markers added to represent site details and mission outcomes.
- Popups and tooltips included to enhance map interactivity.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Multiple classification algorithms evaluated.
- Hyperparameter optimization performed using GridSearchCV for all models.
- Best-performing model selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Final Presentation and Report
- Summary of findings from EDA and modeling.
- Visualizations supporting insights.
- Conclusions based on overall project results.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data.
- Identify factors influencing launch success.
- Build machine learning models to predict mission outcomes.
- Present insights using visualizations, mapping, and reporting.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Folium)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
- IBM Watson Studio

## Key Results
- Distinct patterns identified across launch sites and booster types.
